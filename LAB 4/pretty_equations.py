#TODO: we need to take in three intergers as coeffiecents to quadratic equation
# three if statments are needed:
# - if the number is negative
#       we need to change (+) to (-) in the equation in print statment (terenary statment??)
# - if the number is 1
#       we ommitt the coefficent in the print statment
# - if the number is 0
#       we omitt the coefficent and the varible and the (+ / -) sign
#       because of this condition, we may need to have the print statments inside of if statments
#       that checks wether or not the coeffiecent is non-zero
